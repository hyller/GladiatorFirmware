#################### Qtools Revision History ##########################

Qtools Version 5.4.0 (27-Apr-2015)
----------------------------------
Added the avrdude utility to the Windows release. Modified the qclean
utility to use the Windows EOL convention for .txt files.


Qtools Version 5.3.1 (21-Apr-2014)
----------------------------------
Corrected the version representation from hex to decimal, to match the
change in the QP framework. The version representation mismatch caused
problems in parsing newly modified trace records, when the qspy.c
implementation was inserted directly into the projects.


Qtools Version 5.3.0 (31-Mar-2014)
----------------------------------
Added new trace records to QSPY host application: QS_QEP_TRAN_HIST,
QS_QEP_TRAN_EP, and QS_QEP_TRAN_XP. Changed labels for standard records
from Q_ENTRY, Q_EXIT, Q_INIT to ENTRY, EXIT, INIT.


Qtools Version 5.1.1 (15-Oct-2013)
----------------------------------
Fixed the bug in the QSPY host application, which didn't handle
correctly object/functions/signal names longer than 32 characters. The
name limit has been raised to 64 characters and this version also
correctly truncates the names at the limit without printing any garbage
characters.


Qtools Version 5.1.0b (01-Oct-2013)
-----------------------------------
Modified the stripped-down MinGW C++ compiler included in the Qtools for
Windows distribution to correctly compile the std::cout stream from
<iostream>.


Qtools Version 5.1.0a (18-Sep-2013)
-----------------------------------
Modified QSPY utility to support changes in QP 5.1.x:

-improved handling of target resets by adding an empty QS record
 before the QS_QP_RESET record. The empty record provides the frame
 delimiter in case the last record in incomplete, so that the
 following QS_QP_RESET record can be recognized.

-improved hanlding of internal object/function/signal dictionaries
 so that symbolic information is displayd for all occurrences of an
 object/function/signal, for which a dictionary record was received.


Qtools Version 5.0.0a (08-Sep-2013)
-----------------------------------
Modified QSPY utility to support changes in QP 5.0.x. In particular:

-modified the standard trace records QS_QF_TICK, and QS_QF_TIMEEVT_*
 to contain the tick-rate number.

-added trace records QS_TEST_RUN and QS_TEST_FAIL for unit testing.

-added version compatibility level 5.0, whereas specifying version
 -v 4.5 runs qspy in the compatibility mode with QP 4.5.x.

-added Find And Replace Text (FART) utility for Windows


Qtools Version 4.5.06 (07-Apr-2013)
-----------------------------------
Added TCL/TK 8.4 to the Qtools collection for Windows.

Fixed a bug in qspy.c for formatting of user-defined I32 elements
(used SPRINTF_AT() rahter then SPRINTF_LINE()).


Qtools Version 4.5.05 (26-Mar-2013)
-----------------------------------
Modified QSPY source code (qspy.c) to use the standard PRIx64
macros defined in <inttypes.h> for portable formatting 64-bit
integers. This eliminates all format-related warnings generated
by the MinGW compiler.

Added a rudimentary <inttypes.h> header file to qspy\win32\vc
directory for compatibility with Microsoft Visual Studio.

Replaced the MinGW compiler included in the collection to smaller
version GCC 4.5.2.


Qtools Version 4.5.04 (31-Jan-2013)
-----------------------------------
Modified the QSPY source code to consistently use the size_t type
in "hal.h" instead of "unsigned int", so that the QSPY utility
builds cleanly on 64-bit systems.

Modified the qtools\qspy\win32\mingw\make.bat file to use the
MinGW compiler now included in the Qtools collection for Windows.


Qtools Version 4.5.03 (26-Nov-2012)
-----------------------------------
Added the MinGW C/C++ compiler to the Qtools collection for Windows.
Changed the location of executables from the root of Qtools to
the bin\ subdirectory. This is done to accomodate the structure
of the MinGW compiler.


Qtools Version 4.5.02 (21-Jul-2012)
-----------------------------------
Re-designed the QSPY interface to support more flexible parsing
of the trace records in desktop-based simulations (such as Windows
or Qt). Users can provide a custom parsing callback function to
QSPY_config(). Also added QS_RESET() macro to reset the internal
dictionaries (and other cleanup in the future) when the target
resets.


Qtools Version 4.5.01 (25-Jun-2012)
-----------------------------------
Added the QS_USR_DICTIONARY() entry for storing dictionaries of
the user trace records. Replaced all remaining sprintf() calls
with snprintf().


Qtools Version 4.5.00 (26-May-2012)
-----------------------------------
Re-designed the implementation of the QSPY host application, so
that it can be convenienty included as part of the QP library.
This allows direct QS tracing output to the screen for QP applications
running on the desktop. The QSPY application has been converted from
C++ to plain C for easier integration with QP/C.


Qtools Version 4.3.00 (03-Nov-2011)
-----------------------------------
This QSPY version mataches the changes to the critical section
macros made in QP 4.3.00. The QS record names QS_QF_INT_LOCK and
QS_QF_INT_UNLOCK have been replaced with QS_QF_CRIT_ENTRY and
QS_QF_CRIT_EXIT, respectively.


Qtools Version 4.2.04 (27-Sep-2011)
-----------------------------------
This QSPY version fixes the bug of incorrect reporting function
or object pointers for which the dictionary records are not
provided and which are repeated in one format line (bug #3405904).
For example, trace record AO.FIFO would report (incorrectly) as
follows:

0014004078 AO.FIFO: Sndr=200009B4 Obj=200009B4
Evt(Sig=00000009,Obj=200009B4, Pool= 0, Ref= 0)
Queue(nFree=  5, nMin=  5)

The Sndr= and Obj= are reported to be the same, but they were not.


Qtools Version 4.2.01 (01-Aug-2011)
-----------------------------------
This QSPY version adds generation of sequence diagrams as
files to be processed by MscGen (www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/).
This version adds the option -g<msc_file> to generate .msc
file.

Also, this version of QSPY for Windows allows COM ports
larger than COM9.


Qtools Version 4.2.00 (13-Jul-2012)
-----------------------------------
This QSPY version matches the changes made to QS target code in
QP/C/C++ 4.2.xx. These changes include sending the additinal byte
of sender priority in trace records:

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,

Additional changes include sending the poolID and refCtr of events
in two bytes instead of just one byte. The changes affect the
following trace records:

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_FIFO,

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_POST_LIFO,
- QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET,

- QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET,

- QS_QF_ACTIVE_GET_LAST,

- QS_QF_EQUEUE_GET_LAST,

- QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_FIFO,

- QS_QF_EQUEUE_POST_LIFO,

- QS_QF_PUBLISH,

- QS_QF_GC_ATTEMPT, and

- QS_QF_GC.

Also, for compatibility with the QP 4.2.xx, this version changes
the defaults as follows:

signal size (-S) from 1 byte to 2 bytes, and

baud rate (-b) from 38400 to 115200

This version adds the following trace record:

QS_QF_TIMEEVT_CTR

The version also adds compatiblity with 64-bit targets (such
as 64-bit linux). This version can accept 8-byte pointers (both
object pointers and function pointers) as well as 64-bit
integers sent in user-defined trace records.

This version also adds the hex format for uint32_t integers
sent in the user-defined trace records.

Finally, this version adds command-line option -v to specify
the corresponding QP version running on the target. The default
version is -v4.2, but by specifying version -v4.1 or -v4.0 will
switch QSPY into the backwards-compatibility mode with the
earlier versions of QP.


Qtools Version 4.1.06 (09-Feb-2011)
-----------------------------------
This is the intial standalone release of the QSPY host application.
QSPY is still available in the QP/C and QP/C++ distributions, but
other rapid prototyping platforms (such as mbed or Arduino) do not
use the standard QP distributions and have no easy access to the
QSPY tool. For these users, this pre-compiled standalone release
is more convenient.
