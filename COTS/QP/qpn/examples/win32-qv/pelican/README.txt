The Win32 version of the "PEdestrian LIght CONtrolled" (PELICAN) Crossing
example is now located in the directory:

qpn\examples\arm-cm\pelican_ek-tm4c123gxl\win32-qv

This co-location of the Win32 emulation with the embedded code running
on the actual board demonstrates better the "dual targeting" development
approach.
